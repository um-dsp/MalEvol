What is CapTipper?
------------------

CapTipper_ is a python tool to analyze, explore and revive HTTP malicious traffic.
CapTipper sets up a web server that acts exactly as the server in the PCAP file,
and contains internal tools, with a powerful interactive console, for analysis and inspection of the hosts, objects and conversations found.

The tool provides the security researcher with easy access to the files and the understanding of the network flow,
and is useful when trying to research exploits, pre-conditions, versions, obfuscations, plugins and shellcodes.

CapTipper is released under the GPLv3_ license and is copyrighted by `Omri Herscovici`_.
The source code is available on `GitHub`__.
